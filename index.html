			These wounds, they will not heal 
			Fear is how I fall 
			Confusing what is real<br/><br/>

			There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface 
			Consuming, confusing 
			This lack of self control I fear is never ending 
			Controlling, I can't seem <br/><br/>

			To find myself again 
			My walls are closing in 
			(Without a sense of confidence I’m convinced that there’s just too much pressure to take)

			So insecure <br/><br/>
		
			Crawling in my skin
			These wounds, they will not heal
			Fear is how I fall
			Confusing what is real <br/><br/>

			Discomfort, endlessly has pulled itself upon me 
			Distracting, reacting 
			Against my will I stand beside my own reflection 
			It's haunting how I can't seem<br/><br/>
